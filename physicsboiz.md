# Outline $\circ$ Branches $\circ$ Concepts $\circ$ Topics $\circ$ Physics (x)
__Physics__ ‚Äì natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion through spacetime, along with related concepts such as energy and force. More broadly, it is the general analysis of nature, conducted in order to understand how the universe behaves. a scientific discipline that seeks to construct and experimentally test theories of the physical universe. The solution of tractable problems in nature.

__Universe__ - everything that physically exists: the entirety of space and time, all forms of matter, energy and momentum, and the physical laws and constants that govern them. However, the term 'universe' may also be used in slightly different contextual senses, denoting concepts such as the cosmos or the philosophical world.
